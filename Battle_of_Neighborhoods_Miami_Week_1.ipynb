    "\n",
    "The Battle of Neighborhoods is a Coursera Capstone project that seeks to use Foursquare location data, in combination with other selected data, to develop a business case around the suitability of a particular neighborhood for the opening of a new Restaurant in a given City. The city selected for this endeavour was Miami, well-known for being a touristic magnet, and, therefore, a good opportunity for the restauration industry, which seeks to consistently respond to a high demand of food, while maintaining a steady operation in a safe neighborhood. This goal can be approached by gathering and processing enough information towards decision making. This information is often not given, thus requires structured and/or intensive searches, depending on the availability of the information. In this regard, the recourse to Foursquare to obtain ample information about the venues in a specific location is a good starting point, but this information should be processed adequately to segregate the signal from the noise. Furthermore, this information can be also be complemented by additional information, when required, to gather enough insights prior to providing a constructive feedback to a client. \n"
